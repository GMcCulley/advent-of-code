# Advent of Code

This is where ny submissions will go for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com)

The following are rules I have given myself for theses challenges:

- No use of AI tools such as ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.
- No searching the web for solutions to problems
- Web searches may only persisting of syntax issues, unknown algorithms, and language specific questions (nothing that relates to the specific problem being solved in any way)
- Any rule break in a solution must have a comment describing which rule was broken with a possible explanation as to why
